SalesInsights_AtliqSoftware
A practice project to build data analytics skills.
Here I'm making use of data from a software company called Atliq software. Atliq is a supplier of the software components like laptops, computer accessories etc. It has its distribution across many regions in India.
The company's sales manager is interested in knowing the reasons for the drop in sales in different regions.
It is difficult for the manager to check on individually with the regional managers. Hence they come to a conclusion on investing on building a dashboard which shows all the data at one place.
Now we the data analysts come into action.

For the process of analysing data to help business take decisions, we follow the following 6 steps approach.
 1. ASK:-
    This is where we ask the business about their goal and mission. We also ask for the business problem that we are trying to solve using data analytics.
    Here the business problem is " To identify the revenue and profit trends for different regions and for different timeframes."
    Next we identify the key stakeholders.
    Sales manager- The end user of the report
    Data Engineers- The architects of the database who give us access to database
    Data Analysts- The co- workers
 
 2. PREPARE:-
    Here we check the availability of the data and perform actions to get access to the data.
    In this project we have the data dump in the .sql file which we will be importing into mysql workbench and perform analysis.
    Identify how the data is organised and perform sorting and filtering the data.
   
 3. PROCESS:-
    This is the phase where we decide on the tools that we use further to perform analysis.
    Check the data for errors if any.
    We use SQL for storing the data and we use Tableau to perform exploratory analysis and create dashboards.
    Transform the data effectively to work with it effectively. Here we are exploring the data to understand the relationship between different data tables.
   
 4. ANALYSIS:-
    This is the phase where you perform the actual analysis of data to drive business decisions.
    We are performing analysis using tableau desktop where we are connecting all the 5 tables to create a data model.
    Aggregate the data so that it's useful and accesible.
    Organize and format the data.
    Make any sort of conversions and filtering to make the data consistent.
    Create few calculations that help us answer our analysis.
    Identify the trends and relations.
   
  5. SHARE:-
    Now that we have performed analysis and gained some insights from data, we create visualizations to share our findings.
    Create dashboards to show revenue analysis and the profit analysis.
    Present the finding to the stakeholders with a good presentation.
    After testing the data for accuracy, publish the dashboard on to the tableau server and give access to the relevent stakeholders.
   
  6. ACT:- 
    Now that we have created the visualizations, we have to act on our findings. Now the sales manager look for the data from the dashboard and takes further actions along with the regional managers.
